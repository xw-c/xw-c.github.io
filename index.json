Befor in 2022, I graduated from the AI Turing class in the School of EECS in Peking University and got my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in computer graphics, especially physically based animation. I have been working on thin-shell simulation and collision detection, aiming at providing efficient and robust simulation tools for reconstructing the world model on a virtual platform. Recently, I have gained a new interest about garment simulation combined with learning-based approaches.\nApart from research, I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in Chinese operas and Chinese chess.\n","date":1729728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1729728000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/xuwen-chen/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/xuwen-chen/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a third-year PhD student in the School of Intelligence Science and Technology in Peking University, advised by Prof. Baoquan Chen.
